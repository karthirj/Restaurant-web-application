# Restaurant-web-application

• The project's main goal is to provide a forum for customers to get a good picture of the restaurant.

• Potential customers need to know what to expect when they visit our restaurant, so the web application includes all of the necessary information, such as the restaurant's ambiance and the food menu, which lists the various dishes available. 

• The application allows customers to leave suggestions that can help the restaurant enhance the quality of the dishes and provide better customer service. 

• The application also allows customers to read reviews about the restaurant so that they can get a better understanding about what the majority of other people like about it. 

• Customers may make a reservation by providing their information and selecting time slots to reduce long wait times. 

• The application also includes the restaurant's address and contact details, which can be useful to customers if they have any questions.
